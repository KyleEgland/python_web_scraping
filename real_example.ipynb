    "# Synopsis: I play the game Android Netrunner and would like to make a data set/database\n",
    "# of tournment winning decks with the name and the card list.  The names will be specially crafted\n",
    "# so that it identifies the set (it's important if you play the game), the tournament name, and the\n",
    "# faction (corp or runner).  All this information is important for my purposes, if you don't\n",
    "# understand what was just said don't worry about it!  The desired endstate is to have the card sets\n",
    "# then saved as a document with that name.  I'll be able to use that information for later analysis\n",
    "# and use in online collections so that I can read through each card.\n",
    "# The target site will be https://stimhack.com/tournament-decklists/ which contains tables\n",
    "# with hyperlinks to the winning decks for a given entry. This notebook will be a little messy as I'm intending\n",
    "# to leave in the bits where I figure this out (I.e. adjust my targeting on the site to scrape it, finding tables\n",
    "# following links, etc.).\n",
    "# Plan:\n",
    "# 1) Check robots.txt - ensure we're not breaking rules!\n",
    "# 2) Parse the target document so that we can programatically links and names\n",
    "# 3) Put the deck names and links in a data frame\n",
    "# 4) Follow each link to get the web doc in which the cards are listed\n",
    "# 5) Parse the page with card lists\n",
